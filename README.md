# Collective Experience APIs

This is a collection of APIs and engines for creating collective experiences.

### A few things to keep track of:
 * See https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/writing-a-package/#tmc-writing-tests-for-package-code.
 * after making an example application to include the package in, link the folder (`ln -s [package-dir] [dest-dir]`) of the package to the `packages/` folder in the example application
 * test that individual package with `meteor test-packages packages/location-engine`
